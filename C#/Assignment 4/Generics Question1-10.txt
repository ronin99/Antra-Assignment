1.Describe the problem generics address.
Generic allows you to use a class or method that can work with any data type, so if we use generic we probably won't cause any type of error.



2.How would you create a list of strings, using the generic List class?
List<T> list = new List<T>();


3.How many generic type parameters does the Dictionary class have?
Two such as Dictonary<TKey,TValue>


4.true/False. When a generic class has multiple type parameters, they must all match.
False


5.What method is used to add items to a List object?
List.Add() or List.Insert() or List.AddRange()


6.Name two methods that cause items to be removed from a List.
List.Remove(): remove object 
List.RemoveAt(): use index to remove



7.How do you indicate that a class has a generic type parameter?
Typename<T>


8.True/False. Generic classes can only have one generic type parameter.
False


9.True/False. Generic type constraints limit what can be used for the generic type.
False


10.True/False. Constraints let you use the methods of the thing you are constraining to.
True.
